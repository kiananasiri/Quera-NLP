Rojan and the Lost Word
In a land where words held magic and every phrase was a bridge to an extraordinary concept, there lived a curious and imaginative girl named Rojan. She adored words—words that could heal wounds, bring joy to hearts, or unveil the profound secrets of the universe.
One day, in the small village marketplace, an old man approached her. His robe seemed to be woven from the pages of ancient books, and his eyes sparkled like two stars in the night. In a gentle voice, he said:
“Child, did you know that in every person’s heart, there is a lost word? A word that, once found, will reveal the meaning of life.”
Amazed, Rojan asked, “What is that word?”
The old man smiled and replied, “Everyone must find their own lost word. But I can tell you this—it won’t be an easy journey. You’ll need to pass through the Land of Words, confront the shadows of doubt, and open your heart to all emotions.”
The Beginning of the Journey
That night, Rojan couldn’t sleep. Determined to find her lost word, she packed a small bag at dawn and headed into the forest that, according to local tales, led to the Land of Imagination.
Midway through her journey, she encountered a talking bird named Saru. Saru said:
“Rojan, your journey will be full of challenges. I can guide you, but at every stage, you must learn an important word. Only then can you find your lost word.”
The First Word: Friendship
The first stop was a village where no one spoke. The people moved in silence, their faces devoid of expression. Surprised, Rojan asked Saru, “Why isn’t anyone speaking here?”
Saru replied, “Because the people of this village have lost the meaning of friendship. If you can teach them what it means, you will earn your first word.”
Rojan began reaching out to the villagers. Through smiles, gestures, and small gifts, she encouraged them to connect. Slowly, the village came alive with laughter and conversation, and the people extended their hands in friendship to one another.
An elderly woman gave her a golden leaf and said, “This is the word Friendship. You have completed the first stage.”
The Second Word: Love
Rojan continued her journey and reached a valley filled with strange mirrors. Each mirror reflected the image of a person, but in most, the faces appeared lonely and sorrowful.
Saru said, “This is the Valley of Love. To gain the second word, you must truly understand what love means.”
Rojan wandered through the mirrors for hours. In one mirror, she saw her own reflection helping someone in need. In that moment, she realized that love is about giving without expecting anything in return.
As she embraced this truth, one of the mirrors shattered, and the word Love emerged as a glowing butterfly.
The Final Word: Courage
Rojan and Saru arrived at a towering mountain, from whose peak the sound of weeping echoed. Saru said, “The final word is here, but to claim it, you must face your greatest fear.”
Rojan climbed the rocky mountain. As she ascended, the wind grew stronger, and the crying louder. Suddenly, a terrifying shadow appeared, blocking her path. The shadow roared, “Turn back! This is not your place!”
Trembling, Rojan remembered the meanings of friendship and love. With a firm voice, she declared:
“I am not afraid of you, because I carry something greater than fear in my heart.”
With these words, the shadow vanished, and the word Courage shone like the sun in the sky.
The End of the Journey
Rojan returned with three vital words: Friendship, Love, and Courage. When she reached the old man, he smiled and said:
“Your lost word is now complete, for each of these three words is a part of it. The word you were searching for is Life. Life without friendship, love, and courage is meaningless.”
Tears filled Rojan’s eyes as she smiled. She had discovered that every word in the human world holds a profound meaning, and that life itself is a journey to uncover these meanings.
